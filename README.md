# Heart Disease Dataset Analysis 🫀

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to identify key patterns and correlations between variables.

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the distribution of patient features (age, cholesterol, etc.)
- Identify variables correlated with heart disease presence
- Prepare the dataset for potential machine learning tasks

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Older patients and those with higher resting blood pressure showed higher likelihood of heart disease.
- Certain chest pain types and fasting blood sugar levels were strongly associated with target variable.

## 📁 Dataset
UCI Heart Disease dataset (freely available for academic use).
